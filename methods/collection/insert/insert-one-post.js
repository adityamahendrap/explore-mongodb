    "Every time I think people can’t amaze me further with their stupidity, I’m sadly mistaken. Yes, stupidity. Or would you rather I say dangerous behavior? Either works.: As of today, in the United States alone, there have been 13.7m cases of the novel coronavirus, with almost 270k deaths.: What in those numbers gives you the idea that travel is a good idea? Now, it would be one thing if people were vacationing to parts unknown, not surrounding themselves with people. But that’s really not the case. People are still going to Disney. The park recently announced they’re open for business again, minus the water parks.: Just be sure if you’re over the age of 2, you wear a mask at all times.: Wearing a mask is important for sure. But you can’t tell me a crowd the size of the ones that frequent Disney isn’t a recipe for disaster. It’s not only dangerous, it’s destructive. No amount of memory making is worth the potential for death, or at the least, severe illness.: I blame the companies for agreeing to open in such a dangerous situation. I blame our government for not doing more to stop this on the front end. But I also blame the people of the United States who can’t put their plans on hold for a little longer in order to remain safe, and for the health and well-being of others.: Going on vacation would be a godsend right now for my family. We’ve been stuck at home since March, invading one another’s space, constantly under each other. Sure, it’s nice to spend time with your family, but enough is enough. Through all this, there’s no vacation on this planet that’s worth our continued health. We even avoided a small Thanksgiving get-together to ensure we remained virus free.: Whether you have children, if you’re single or married, your health and well-being are important. Consistently masking up, only going out when absolutely necessary, and avoiding crowds goes a long way towards ending this pandemic. Taking a family vacation, just because it’s what you’ve always done, isn’t the smart answer.: The state of the world isn’t what it’s always been. We have to adapt and overcome. Roll with the punches, if you will. But for all that is holy, stay home this holiday season and plan the vacations for when it’s safer. If you don’t, your vacation memories could be the last ones you make.",
